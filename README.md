# $\pi$-approximations
This is a place to record implementations in Python of various methods for approximating $\pi$.

The above notebooks record the following.

pi geometry: unsurprisingly, the most obvious approach to the problem is approximating the area in (a part of) a circle and in this notebook we record some attempts at that.

pi probability: we discuss some probabilistic approaches including the famous Buffon's needle problem.

pi sums and products: we calculate partial sums and products of some well-known amusing examples that converge to values related to $\pi$.

pi zeros: we implement various approaches to the problem of finding the value of $x$ such that $\cos(x)=0$, i.e. $\pi/2$ including the Newton-Raphon-method and its slower, and much less famous cousin, Halley's method.
