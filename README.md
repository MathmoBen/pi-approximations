# Some methods for approximating $\pi$
This is a place to record implementations in Python of various methods for approximating $\pi$.

The above notebooks record the following.

pi geometry: unsurprisingly, the most obvious approach to the problem is approximating the area in (a part of) a circle and in this notebook we record some attempts at that.

pi probability: we discuss some probabilistic Monte Carlo approaches including the famous Buffon's needle problem.

pi sums and products: we calculate partial sums and products of some well-known amusing examples of series that converge to values related to $\pi$.

pi zeros: we implement various approaches to the problem of finding, for example, the value of $x$ such that $\cos(x)=0$, i.e. $\pi/2$, including the Newton-Raphon-method, its generaliztions to higher order Householder methods and the slower, and much less famous cousin, Lion Hunting method.

pi integrals: use approximate numerical integration to approximate some integrals whose value is known to be related to $\pi$. These approximations tend to be not very good.
